# Web Development Project 4 - CatsDiscoverLove

Submitted by: Krishna Choudhary

This web app is an interactive discovery platform that fetches random cat images using an external API (TheCatAPI). Users can view one random cat at a time along with key attributes such as the catâ€™s origin, life span, and weight. They can click on these attributes to add them to a ban list, and any future images containing banned attributes are filtered out. The app also maintains a history of previously viewed cats so that users can see what they have already discovered. The project is built with React, using custom hooks for API calls and state management, and features a responsive three-column layout.

Time spent: 8 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **Clicking a button creates a new API fetch request and displays at least three attributes from the returned JSON data**
- [X] **Only one item/API call is viewable at a time**
- [X] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [X] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [X] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
  - [X] To ensure an accurate grade, your recording **must** show that when clicked, an attribute in the ban list is immediately removed from the list of banned attributes
- [X] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] Multiple types of attributes can be added to the ban list
- [X] Users can see a stored history of their previously viewed items from their session

The following **additional** features are implemented:
